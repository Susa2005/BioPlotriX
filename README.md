# BioPlotriX
**An R Shiny-based Biochemical Data Visualization & Standard Curve Automation Tool**

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/records/17819293)]


BioPlotriX is an interactive web-based biochemical graph plotting tool built using **R Shiny**.  
It automates analysis from OD (Optical Density) values, generates standard curves, computes unknown concentrations, and produces publication-ready plots for biochemical experiments.

## Features

- Upload OD (optical density) values
- Generate standard curves dynamically
- Polynomial/linear model curve fitting
- Automatic computation of unknown concentrations
- Interactive visualization of biochemical assay data
- Publication-ready graphs (PNG/Download options)
- Supports multiple biochemical methods:
  - Lowry’s Method (Protein Estimation)
  - Anthrone Method (Carbohydrate Estimation)
  - Barfoed’s Test (Monosaccharide Detection)
  - And additional quantitative assays

## 📌 Purpose

Manual plotting using Excel or paper-based standard curves is time-consuming and prone to human errors.  
BioPlotriX eliminates:
- manual slope calculation,
- formula interpretation,
- and trial-based data transformation.

It offers seamless, accurate, and reproducible visualization for research labs, students, and biotech professionals.

## 🧬 Applications

- Biochemical experiments involving OD readings
- Standard curve generation & interpretation
- Lab practical analysis
- Research data validation
- High-throughput experiment data plotting
- Result reporting in publications

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Input/Upload OD data  
2. Select experimental methodology  
3. The tool automatically:
   - fits the best curve model  
   - plots the graph  
   - computes unknown sample concentration  
4. Download publication-ready output
